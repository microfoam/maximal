This is the README file for the 'waves/chowder' sub-directory.  This 'chowder'
sub-directory is used to hold sequence files currently under attention or
slated for attention during development of the 'maximal' program.
Because the benchmark scripts (typically named 'surfboard-cleanup_set_*') use
sequences in the 'waves/tubespit' sub-directory, some chowder sequences will be
located in duplicate forms in both sub-directories with the same file name. In those
cases, the duplicate file in the chowder sub-directory indicates that the
sequence contained in the file is either no longer solved correctly or else is
not solved optimally even if solved correctly. If a sequece has never been solved correctly
it should be located in the 'chowder' sub-directory even if it is referenced in a 
testing script.
