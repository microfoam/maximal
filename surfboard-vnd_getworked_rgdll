# Running this script should NOT be repeated within 12-18 minutes, the exact time interval depending on the speed of the computer.
# To explain why, please continue reading.
#
# First of all, this time interval is also dependent on the number of loops (2500 currently) and the default or opted Fisher-Yates string length,
#  which is currently set at 100 bp in order to identify "pre-whittled" micro-foam knots. So if these variables change, then the recommended 
#  wait time will also change.
#
# By waiting these few extra minutes between consecutive ragdoll runs, you ensure that each run is a uniquely shuffled string 
#  generated by the random seed, which is based on the sum of elapsed unix time in seconds plus loop number.
#
# Lastly, the addition of the loop number to time(0) is necessitated by the short time it takes to complete one loop (less than one second).
#
# So there you have it. Have fun! Throw your ragdoll self into the washing machine!
